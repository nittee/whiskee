*Not a fear mongering doomsday BS. Just a long ass rant about the weather.*

<br>
<br>

In April 2022, I remember social media exploding with environmentalist discourse centered on climate change, under the hashtag #LetTheEarthBreathe. On April 15, 2022, local newspaper Inquirer reported that the hashtag soared to the top in Twitter Philippines, with about one and a half million tweets. This was in solidarity to thousands of scientists all over the world staging a protest on April 6 in the same year. It was a response to the report that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change dropped. It almost sounded like a final warning. According to the report, we only have a few years before the planet passes the so-called threshold (reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial temperatures) and all hell breaks loose. Now, year 2024, it has already broken loose. And we - at least us Filipinos - all feel the scorching inferno that the science people are warning everyone about.

I was never a global warming denier. And yes, it was drilled into us in elementary school. It was like it's the big boss when it comes to environmental problems. Environmental events and organizations are common throughout my school life. We would make crafts out of plastic bottles and old newspapers. We would collect junk or clean up parks as activities. We would participate in environmentalist events featuring fun runs, fairs, games, or concerts. I became a member of some environmentalist organizations, although I haven't contributed much to them to be honest. Once a classmate asked me if I throw my trash anywhere. Confused at the question, I answered 'sometimes', trying to be funny and genuine. She frowned and pointed at the shirt I was wearing: it was from one of those orgs. But yeah, I rarely ever litter since high school.

Despite - or *because* of - the notoriety of urban Philippines when it comes to pollution, being nature-oriented (*makakalikasan*) is one of the four traits in the country's national motto. The other three are God-fearing (*maka-Diyos*), humanitarian (*maka-tao*), and nationalistic (*makabansa*). We would recite this motto as we pledge allegiance with the national flag - something that we do every Monday.

When I was a preteen, I became engrossed with all those doomsday bullshit. In 2012, I heard the phrase "End of the World" for the first time in the local news and it quickly seared in my mind. It became an existential fear that I expressed through writing shitty stories where humanity encountered every natural disaster one-by-one as if God had a checklist. My imaginative ass, who had never read the Bible that much, was convinced back then that the Biblical apocalypse will be manifested via global warming. I just heard somewhere that God will use fire on Judgement Day, so I thought global warming is "fire" so yeah it must be it. Nothing happened on May 21, 2012. Or on December 21, 2012. Or on whatever date the doomsday people picked for whatever reason. As I grew up, my fixation with disaster and doomsday declined. The climate's temperature, however, definitely did not decline.

And perhaps that's the reason why I never questioned the global warming thing. Because we do experience the days getting hotter. 

The Philippines has 2 seasons, wet and dry. But most people would add another distinct "season": cool season.

![Philippines seasons graph](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqwb0kcii/image/upload/v1720526787/24-05-11-philippines_seasons_i6ggm4.png "Philippines seasons compared to other places")

It's early May right now, part of the blazing dry season in the country. There were occasional rains lately, but it only made the concrete landscape here steam like a burning coal that got sprayed on. The heat would usually get this damp quality, featuring the classic earthly smell when it rains and the sensation of being inside an air fryer. Nonetheless, the occasional rains were welcomed, despite being so meager that they barely made the ground wet. In Philippine culture, the first rain in May is believed to be miraculous, with some claiming that it can cure minor illnesses. I guess I can see why anyone would call the first raindrops after a scorching month miraculous.

The dry season in the country has two distinct parts. In December, the cool winds from the north trickle down to the country, creating the beloved cold and dry Christmas season. In March, the so-called "summer" starts in the country. Scorching sunny days that peaks in April. My experiences with the country's dry seasons over the years paint a trend that mirrors global warming. The unbearable heat of 2024 summer that we are experiencing right now is the very thing that prompted me to write this rant.

The biggest thing I wanted to point out is the jump. I've always observed that summer gets hotter and hotter every year. But the difference between summer 2023 and summer 2024 caught everyone off guard. The shit spiked like crazy. In 2023, I had a PE called "walking for fitness", where I had to walk around the city for the requirements. The heat was intense, as expected. We would complain about it, like we always do. But we would get back to work, maybe drink a glass of water or two. Now, the heat is literally unbearable. Now, just existing makes you sweaty. Go outside in the afternoon and the sun would mildly burn - also literally. The house would start to heat up at as early as 8 AM in the morning. For the first time, there are widespread suspension of classes due to the heat. Although it may be partly because of the academic year going all the way to May instead of ending in March, thanks Covid. Whereas I could stroll across the goddamn city in 2023, now I can barely walk outside without panting. Another thing I want to point out is how often we get thirsty. In the past, my family would call me and my siblings birds for barely drinking any water throughout the day. Now, I would chug every 5 minutes, managing to empty a liter in a few hours.

The numbers that I would see wouldn't lie too. The local weather agency, PAGASA (Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration), logged a streak of days with dangerous heat indices ("feels like" temperatures), going as high as an astounding 50 degrees Celsius. Manila alone reached an all-time record of a feverish 38.8 degrees Celsius, with a sizzling heat index of 45 degrees Celsius. Looking outwards to the bigger picture, the records also show that the global temperature does rise steadily. And yes, the jump is captured by the data as well. The line graph soars with a rising angle. In fact, 2023 is hailed as the globally hottest year since 1850 (and according to them, likely a hundred thousand years ago) by the EU climate monitors - with temperatures almost crossing the aforementioned threshold. In the Philippines, PAGASA recorded 2023 as the 11th hottest.

*I made a shitty graph with Excel and data from timeanddate.com. it's surprisingly hard to look for such data on the web lol.*

*This C3S graph spotlighted by the World Meteorological Organization is just one of the many global temperature graphs telling the same story: the slowly skyrocketing trends of 2023 and 2024.*

The worsening climate can still be observed in other parts of the year. For example, while the Christmas season can still be quite cold, it gets less and less cold every year. Christmas chill in 2023 had us boiling water before taking a morning bath and sometimes sleeping under blankets at night. It seems alright until I look back at the past cool seasons in the country. Around 2010, we would wear jackets and pajamas at night. We would even wear socks and sleep under blankets as well. 

In June onwards, while summer is blazing in North America and Europe, the Philippines experiences an intermittent barrage of rains. That's the wet season or "rainy season" as we call it. Naturally, it'll feel cool, but only when it rains. Floods are common in the country, especially in the urban areas. Kudos for the deforestation in the mountains, and the poor conditions of the local creeks and rivers. A lot of people aren't convinced that worse rains and typhoons are caused by global warming. Perhaps because it's hard to imagine how heating up the ocean gives birth to a giant rotating mass of rain clouds. In 2009, typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) submerged about half of the entire greater Manila. The urban area never experienced anything worse ever since. But the other parts of the country sure did. In 2013, super typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) devastated much of the central part of the country. The monster of a typhoon was hailed as among the strongest. In Manila, about 400-500 kilometers away from the typhoon's eye, roofs would still fly and trees would still headbang into baldness with the winds.

Typhoons in general are terrifying. But when something like a mere monsoon wave managed to spell disaster that rivals an actual typhoon, one would know something is up with these rain cloud snippets. A notable one was in 2012-2013, when the southwest monsoon unexpectedly casted great floods in many parts of the country. The flooding in the Manila area was so bad people started to remember the aforementioned typhoon Ondoy, which was about 3-4 years ago at that time..

Nowadays, while typhoons seem to visit less frequently, they tend to be more devastating. Super typhoons, storms with speeds exceeding 185 kph, are becoming more common. The aforementioned super typhoon Haiyan prompted the government to create a fourth "tropical cyclone wind signal" - storm warnings that originally had 3 levels or "signals". Later on, a fifth signal will be added as well. In the 2020's, typhoons and super typhoons started triggering signal number 5. As someone who grew up knowing signal number 3 is the most devastating, it's a pretty intense feeling, even if you know it's just a new measurement of the same thing. My grandmother once mulled, as super typhoon Karding (Noru) arrived in the country, that in her decades of life she had never encountered a signal number 5 before.

Experiencing and seeing the data of these trends made me think of the seemingly fear mongering 2022 hullabaloo I described in the beginning. Something definitely tipped. A limit that got crossed perhaps. A walk into the point-of-no-return area. I did what they said. I cleaned up my email. I started using Ecosia and I'm still using it now. I kept doing the minimals I've already been doing: not littering, not using plastic straws, conserving electricity and water. I also engaged with the social media craze. But if you think about it, it's another one of those social media political activities where one feels intense passion as they barely contribute to the cause. Sure, it raised awareness, but personally, I've barely done anything about it. I'm concerned about the climate, but here I am writing a shitty blog about it instead of taking action. I might *feel* like I'm contributing, but I'm barely doing anything. Maybe it does take quite a courage to be radicalized. And maybe hope. Hope that you would make a difference. Despite looking outside and seeing environmental activists being murdered, big companies getting away with their actions, and your country being mined, deforested, and commercialized to death. On top of that, you will still see a handful of people denying the entire thing, claiming that it's all normal and "natural", despite the significant human impact in it.

I would imagine the future and the clearest images I would get are almost apocalyptic: heat you wouldn't imagine possible, people dropping here and there due to heat stroke, work and school being paralyzed, water drying up, electricity burning out, crops dying away. Of course, this may be a product of my wild overthinking imagination. But I can see a gist of them by merely looking around right now and observing what is happening. I wouldn't want to raise kids in such a world. I have doubts if societies in such a world will be stable, let alone liveable.

Perhaps a good "article" pointing problems should end by recommending solutions. I kinda don't want to. Partly because I'm too dumb and uninformed for that - I'm just an ordinary citizen complaining about the damn heat. Like many societal problems, ordinary citizens get hit the hardest. And partly because the solutions I come up with are already said anyway. Also, it's tempting to end this with "welcome to the climate apocalypse".

But I guess I would like to emphasize quality education about it, just like what I want to do with most societal problems. Accountability to individuals and companies destroying nature is a must as well. It's a big thing, going after those gigantic bastards and leeches of the planet. But until we go after the big ones, I doubt if our collective efforts would make a significant difference.

The bottom line is that we entered a new stage in this battle. A next level battle. I might say it's urgent, but maybe it's not. Maybe it's just El Niño, but this will hardly be the last El Niño in our lives. Maybe the climate here will be as periodic and constant as what I've seen in my shitty graph. But the only clear thing is that it's becoming unbearable to live. "It's just nature," some would say. But it's not just nature, it's nature *and* us humans. We fucked it up, now it's fighting back.

Welcome to the climate apocalypse.
