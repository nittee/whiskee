*[Image by jcomp on Freepik] A close look at my personal experience with MLM/pyramid scheme recruitment*

<br>

> Note on currency: In this post, "dollar" refers to US dollar. To avoid confusion, let's just say that in the 2020's in my country, an average meal at a fastfood is only 2-3 US dollars. Our DAILY minimum wage is aboout 6-12 dollars depending on where exactly you are.

It should have been obvious from the start. A message from a random stranger in one of my social media accounts. Let’s hide this random stranger behind the nickname, Jumbo. It has nothing to do with his physical appearance, but he has this ambitious, airy vibe that I’d describe as that. Jumbo. A fellow young man, perhaps also a college man too. Seemed to be a well-experienced individual. Not a “tech bro” selling random cryptocurrencies or NFTs and celebrating how he got hundreds of thousands off it. Not one of those annoying “entrepreneurs” with profiles flooded with “billionaire mindset” philosophies taken from overrated self-help books. He wasn’t selling anything in fact. Just an ordinary young man. I wanted to make it clear that I have nothing against him personally. His intentions may or may not be good, but in the end he’s just another college student trying to make ends meet who just happened to be captured by this MLM scheme.

Jumbo sent me a message, telling me that they’re offering a part-time job. It’s apparently a “dropshipping” job, which roughly means selling other people’s products remotely. I had to Google that term because I haven’t heard of that before. The workload, he claimed, is around 2-3 hours a day with a flexible schedule. And the salary will be a whopping 300-400 dollars *a week*. He wrote that shit in dollars, a shiny figure in this country. That shit is almost 40 times the daily minimum wage in this country. That shit can feed my entire family for half a month. That shit, I already knew back then, was too good to be true.

So why didn’t I ignore it and dismissed it as another scam? Well for starters, scammers do not scam with their main accounts, showing off their real name and information. A quick inspection with Jumbo’s account - which is not that private - confirmed that. I also cross-referenced it with other social media platforms. Also, I was toying with the idea of getting a side hustle at that time. I thought that the salary was exaggerated bullshit, but getting an income by working a few hours a day is what piqued my attention. I needed money. Even a few dollars a day can help me in my studies. This desire, or maybe desperation, combined with my curiosity and my seize-every-opportunity attitude made me bite the hook. I thought that in the worst case scenario, I’d only waste my time, something that I could afford back then. And that is exactly what happened.

I replied, asking for details. Jumbo immediately dropped a place and a time, telling me that we’ll discuss it there. I thought that it’ll take place in the company’s office. I’ll learn later that the place he gave was the name of a business district, not the company. Still, it’s a rather stupid oversight to not ask about the company name or the exact position. Convinced, I merely asked to confirm that it’s indeed a part-time, flexible, work-from-home job. Jumbo told me he’ll discuss the “business concept” with me there.

So the next day, I found myself commuting to the business district I’ve never been before. It was a fairly fine Wednesday afternoon. It was a holiday, so there’s no school or work. I was wearing smart casual attire. A button-up shirt and a slack, both of which were an effort to iron. I told everyone it was a job interview, which I guess was partly true. 

I reached the place. Got lost a bit - why do malls with weird layouts exist? Jumbo told me to meet up at a nearby fast food restaurant. I did wonder why he chose it as a meeting place. I thought maybe it’s just the meet-up place and that we’ll go to the actual meeting place after that. I even considered the possibility that I’d work as a crew there or something.

I arrived there 30 minutes early. Jumbo was there an hour early. But he made me wait for 30 minutes anyway. I ordered something there as I waited, chatting with him online as I ate. Later, he’ll tell me that he was mentally preparing his “introverted” self at that time. He probably thought that this would be cool for me as a part of his “omg I’m an introvert too!” act but it wasn’t. I thought he was a bit of an asshole for that.

The schedule was originally 7 PM. Apparently, there's a seminar/orientation or something that Jumbo and I will attend. But Jumbo changed it to 6 PM, deciding that we'll just have a little talk in the restaurant instead.

Jumbo was sitting near the door. A laptop, a peculiar textbook, and a few papers on his table. He was rather casual in his maroon tees and pants. When he saw me, he complimented my outfit, which surprised him. We had a pretty laid back introduction. Jumbo has a jumbo charisma and a friendly personality. He was studying in the same university as mine. As early as that, it’s established that we’ll talk like peers making friends, and not as interviewer and interviewee. Much much later, he would ask for my socials and would even take a selfie with me. After the introductions, he asked me what caught my attention with his offer. I told him it’s money, trying to be honest yet funny. We laughed at that, and he told me it’s his reason too when he joined. This gives me pretty important information: he’s not an HR person or anything, he’s an *employee*!

Jumbo opened his laptop and to my surprise showed the first slide to a Powerpoint presentation. I didn’t expect this job discussion to be aided with a goddamn Powerpoint presentation.

It’s a table. Jumbo went through each column, asking me questions with the cells in it as the choices. What's my ideal emergency fund (10K USD)? What's my preferred way of achieving it (business)? What is my monthly salary or allowance (I don't remember if I mentioned my scholarship but if I did, I overshared and should not have done that)?

Jumbo congratulated me for being “qualified”. Saying that I have the right mindset. He told me, however, that getting into sales is a better choice than having a business. He went as far as saying that everyone should learn it.

We then talked about “sales”. Jumbo explained what “dropshipping” is all about. Customer orders to me, I give their order to the supplier, then the supplier gives their order. The key here is that I wouldn't bother handling the products and delivering them to them. My biggest task, Jumbo told me, is advertising them.

The next thing we talk about is a social issue. I wouldn't specify it, but it's a social issue. I was a bit confused at the job-discussion-turned-lecture. But when the next slides reveal some peculiar products that supposedly try to solve those discussed social issues, I got it. It's an ad.

That was the moment when I learned what actually is the company I'm trying to get into. Let's hide it behind the alias, Baloney. Because that's what it most likely is. And also because their actual name sounds as silly as that. Much much later, I'll learn that it has a counterintuitive pronunciation. My brain was reading it wrong the entire time. This means that Jumbo never mentioned the company's goddamn name the entire time he's yapping at me. That, or he was mispronouncing it himself.

Back to the products, it's actually interesting. They have lots of varieties and each has very specific features. Apparently, Baloney is stationed in a wealthy country, with a big share in the US stock market. It was founded by an academic expert in the field. Their headquarters, Jumbo told me, is as big as SM Mall of Asia. That shopping mall is the biggest in the country and among the biggest in the world, boasting millions of square feet in size. He showed me a photo of the headquarters. I saw a bunch of giant metal buildings with round roofs.

The products seem legitimate, and perhaps they are. The specifications are not bullshit-filled. And their purposes are clear and specific. While I'm doubtful, Jumbo did sell it to me. Little did I know that Jumbo has one more card to show: the book.

The “textbook” that I saw as soon as I met him is apparently a book written by an expert, rating every brand of a specific product type out of 5 stars. Like Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes but for a specific type of product. I was intrigued.

Jumbo told me to think of any product similar to Baloney - products that are the same type as the ones they sell. I couldn't think of any despite consuming some of those products myself. So Jumbo just picked a few popular ones and flipped through the book. The products there are arranged alphabetically. He showed me the entries of those popular brands, rated with 3 stars and below. I saw a brand I know with half a star. As you may expect, Baloney’s entry there is rated with 5 stars and a ribbon boasting the word “PLATINUM” in it.

Jumbo compared it to a hotel, even asking me what kind of hotel I would like in terms of how much star it has. In a rather smooth transition, he showed me the five star hotels that he went in thanks to Baloney’s programs or whatever. He was scrolling through his social media and gallery, showing me the pools - both swimming and billiard, the luxurious beds, the foods and alcohol, and all those stuffs.

Jumbo knew every person in his photos, and to be honest, the prospect of connecting with them is what impressed me the most. It's the most realistic one to expect anyway. He narrated how they are university students like me and how financially and academically successful they became. As he introduced the people in his photos, he turned around the restaurant (remember, we are in the fast food restaurant the whole damn time) and pointed at some of his “coworkers”, telling me about them.

Jumbo then grabbed a pen and a piece of paper. We'll now talk about the business model. The spiciest reddest flag is about to appear in front of my face.

Jumbo wrote a bunch of numbers, telling me about Baloney’s “membership” and “scoring system”. Basically, a “membership” in the company shall give me my own website for advertising and a discount for their products. I'd get a portion of the revenue of the products I've successfully advertised. At that moment, I thought I'm getting into some sort of affiliate marketing - a pretty big thing nowadays. Then Jumbo asked me to list down four names of people I know.

I was hesitant to give him names. It's a bit of a creepy thing to ask to be honest, business talk or not. But I eventually gave him four names. Jumbo mad me write those names in the aforementioned paper. He told me that I'll try to sell them Baloney’s products. I knew my family and friends wouldn't buy their products, no matter how much qualifications they have, because they're crazy expensive. There are tons of cheaper and more available alternatives, some of which are used at my own home. Also, I wouldn't want to freaking advertise products to my family and friends.

*Actual photos of the paper that we used that night. Jumbo let me keep it. Names written are blurred.*

When I told Jumbo I don't think I could do that, he enthusiastically calculated how much I would earn if they bought the products. He made me produce more names, telling me how much money I would get even if only a certain percentage of them bought the product. I realized I'd have to advertise the products to every person I know and maybe even strangers. But Jumbo kept assuring me that he'll guide me.

There was a moment the air changed. The sparkles disappeared and the doubts at the back of my head became more real. It was when Jumbo told me that how much would I get if the 4 people I “recruited” recruited 4 people each as well, and if those people recruited even more. This concept is all too familiar to me: it sounded like a pyramid scheme.

But I continued the little talk no matter how fishy everything became. I told myself, if I had to give money, then that's the final red flag. Not giving money is my non-negotiable, pyramid scheme-ish deal or not. I did not waste more time and asked him if I had to give money. He said yes. Bingo.

He told me he borrowed an equivalent of roughly ten thousand dollars from his parents when he got there. Ten fucking thousand dollars. If I borrowed and spent something like that as an “investment”, there would be blood. No way on God's green earth will I throw away money that is enough to feed my entire family for a month. Again I did not waste time. I told him I'm not willing to give money.

Unfortunately, Jumbo wants to waste more time. He asked me for a minimum amount. Still being honest and a little bit hopeful, I told him that it'll be around 100 dollars. I thought it's the highest one I can risk losing. He accepted it, telling me that I can get started with it.

Perhaps smelling my doubts, he asked me how willing I am to start, on the scale of 1 to 10. I told him 6. He asked me, quite cleverly, what can fill up the missing 4. I answered, quite dumbly, assurance. Jumbo showed me more of those qualifications. Reiterating them and again narrating how much I will earn. After another round of talk, he asked me the question again. How willing am I to start? I told him 8.

I realized he wouldn't let me go without me accepting. I looked at my watch, it's almost 8. We've been talking for almost 2 hours. I asked for a time frame, telling him I want to think about it. He said ASAP. Wow.

Jumbo asked me why I needed a time frame. I told him I'll do research first. What will I research, he asked me. Everything, I told him. He showed me some scientific papers, perhaps thinking that I meant scientific research.

We eventually agreed to a time frame of half a day. I had to decide by tomorrow. Jumbo urged me to do it quickly, as he'll recruit another one on the next day. He told me that that person will be “under” me so I'll earn something from them. I can't miss it, he told me.

If everything is fine, we'll see each other in another mall. Jumbo will give me Baloney products, I'll give him the equivalent of roughly a hundred bucks. We'll then begin hunting people I know and don't know, selling the products to them, and making them recruit even more people.

I managed to slip away at almost 9 PM. Jumbo was noticing my deliberate glances at my watch and my increasingly impatient mood. So he decided to let it be over.

Weirdly, I didn't feel like I just dodged a bullet while thinking about it on my way home. In fact, I felt quite optimistic. I felt like I will surprise everyone and even myself with how much I will get from it, money and other stuff. It was midnight when I started my research. It was horrific.

Baloney’s Wikipedia page did confirm all the qualifications and information shared during our meeting. But what Jumbo didn't tell me is the rather colorful history of the company, riddled with lawsuits and controversies. When I saw that they were being investigated multiple times for fraud and “pyramid scheme” like activities, I confirmed my suspicions. There are threads, blogs, and court documents detailing their suspicious activities.

I read the threads. There are tons of stories related to it on the surface web, and almost all of them are horror stories. Social media of people they knew being flooded with ads about the company. Long time no see acquaintances suddenly communicating only to sell you Baloney. People being disrupted at work and school by the ones selling those products. Friendships ending. And lives being ruined because they lost thousands of dollars.

The “seminar” that I almost attended at 7 PM that night was apparently a part of their weekly seminars where people near the “top” of the pyramid talk about their success and the company's qualifications. And the textbook from earlier? Also investigated for apparent fraud. The author was apparently someone who once worked for Baloney. Their business model is apparently called “multilevel marketing” or MLM. A legal but controversial model where profit comes from the revenue of a hierarchical network of distributors. It looked a lot like a pyramid scheme, with some even calling it “legal pyramid scheme.”

It felt kind of scary, being confronted by reality. I was knee deep in it already and was ready to dive in. My doubt saved me I guess. But I should've ran away right away. As you can see, this story is freaking long. It's because I wasted so much time on it. 

As I laid down on my bed, I began cooking up an alibi to tell Jumbo tomorrow. The next morning, I told him that I talked to my family about it (a lie). And that my family told me not to push through, because we'll try to start a small business in a few months (also a lie). I did tell him some truths: that I'm not willing to pour my energy into recruiting people and advertising products; that I also don't have time for their seminars; that I'm not willing to risk friendships for it; and that I only wanted a part time job. 

Sometimes I wonder if I just looked gullible. Or maybe it's merely because I was a college student, a favorite target of those types of things. I doubted my skills at avoiding such things, and even my intelligence.

But I guess people can learn all the time. It's pretty upsetting knowing that I live in a world where a probable fraud so big and organized as Baloney exists. So I thought I am obligated to share this experience. And maybe identify the red flags in the process. Here are some I identified, sorted from biggest red flag to smallest:

&nbsp;🚩 Too good to be true <br>
&nbsp;🚩 Vague details, sometimes with important info not disclosed at all <br>
&nbsp;🚩 You have to give money, especially large sum of money <br>
&nbsp;🚩 Emphasizing wealth and how much money you'll get <br>
&nbsp;🚩 They wouldn't let you go until you accept <br>
&nbsp;🚩 Meeting up at a random place like a fastfood restaurant <br>
&nbsp;🚩 The recruiter is an employee <br>
&nbsp;🚩 Urgency and convincing you to decide ASAP <br>

I didn't push through, fortunately. Jumbo’s first response to my morning message was questioning me about what I saw in my “research”. I didn't tell him about the frauds and the lawsuits. I merely told him about the things I figured I have to do for my “job” there and why I can't do them. The last chat that he sent me was a single word: “alright.”
