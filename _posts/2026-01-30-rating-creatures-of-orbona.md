*[Image from Martin Bergquist (Artstation)] Me back wiith random ahh shii. Also idk it’ll be this long but whatever lol.*

Orbona!! A beautiful blue planet sitting in its star's habitable zone. It features a colorful variety of flora and fauna, as well as an intriguing history of almost 5 billion Orbonian years long. In this blog, we'll rate some of these species, as viewed through the lens of a young human named Eva 9, which was in turn told through the 2024 series *Wondla*, which was based on a book series of the same name, starting in 2010.

## MUTHR

Our first entry isn't really a biological species, but is important nonetheless. See, while Muthr is a robot, she is arguably the most impactful species in the entire series. Girl literally haunts the narrative.

Short for Multi Utility Task Help Robot 06, Muthr is, well, a mother. Muthr raised Eva in an underground sanctuary in the futuristic Earth – Orbona. When I got introduced to this series, I saw baby Eva Nine doing baby things while Muthr doing mother things. All the cute and wholesome shii pours in the first part of the show. And I admit that I wanted this part to be developed more. I mean, that’s what initially hooked me in the show.

This tiny background alone is already a big idea. The concept of a robot raising a kid alone in a bunker is already so crazyyyy!! Like right now, 2025 when AI is quickly infecting more and more of our everyday lives, we might ask how much can AI do for us? Can we go as far as make them replace our *mothers*?!

Throughout the first part of the series, we see the strong emotional connection forming. A connection only a mother and daughter could have. It's still intriguing to see it with a robotic being. Later in the series, this connection remains important no matter what happens. However, we didn't see the idea being explored further. It's very normal for a person to be raised by AI in Orbona I guess. Also, the emotional connection wasn't developed well too imo. 

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'">
  Later, we will only see other Muthr bots that weren't *the* Muthr. And some entities taking the form of Muthr to connect with Eva. It's kinda bad tbh especially after she died. These scenes give us false hope that she's alive. Speaking of which, she did make a slay sacrifice by taking in a sonic-bazooka shot in point blank range, saving her “daughter.” I guess at one point, sixteen-year-old Eva should venture alone, without her beloved Muthr’s motherly mothering.
</span>

Muthr is just one of the many units tasked with mothering. The series featured a smooth and bubbly green design with motherly curves. It's like those simplified logos in baby milk or breastfeeding centers came to life. Interestingly, the books feature something different. Something more robotic and wiry.

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/thesearchforwondla/images/e/ef/Muthr.png/revision/latest?cb=20111206011259" width="350">
*Image from A Search for Wondla wiki*

Oh! And Eva's Muthr has a distinctive drawing mini Eva made with her. What kid doesn’t love crayoning the walls?? Eva was like, oh I can't crayon the walls? What if I crayon *you* mother??

Overall, I would rate Muthr <span style="color:#98bf64;">**8/10**</span>. They definitely know how to mother from caring to hunting you down to the ends of the earth so you don't get late to a meeting (ik it wasn't *Muthr* but it was a Muthr nonetheless hehe).


## DORCEANS
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/skydance-animation/images/7/7f/Besteel.png/revision/latest?cb=20240630221309" width="350">
*Image from Skydance Animation wiki*

Dorceans are scary. Most Orbonian creatures, even the royal guards, fear them. They are big, muscular, and have claws and fur reminiscent of wild cats in ancient Earth. Besteel the hunter is a solid character. Apart from having extraordinary strength and agility, he also carries a weapon. A sonic bazooka thingy that can destroy solid concrete. And yes, the beach also has the brains to hunt you down.

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  Besteel, the main antagonist at least in the first half, left a lasting impression being the first alien that Eva – and us watchers – encountered. He's a real solid antagonist.
</span>

His brother Redimus is another notable Dorcean in the series. Also possessing amazing strength and durability – bro survived being dragged on the rocky wasteland by a spacecraft, he was giggling as it happened. Apart from that, he possesses a *heck yea chaos* personality, without being insufferable.

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'">
  And the sacrifice move where he shot the dome and let himself get buried in the rubble was pretty cool admittedly. Tho it's kinda unnecessary considering there were more enemies coming + it wasn't *that* cool a move lolll but cool nonetheless. Uhhh, I just thought the lying down gesture as he fell down was kinda cringy lol. Also, he's reallllllly quick to embrace the news of his bro's death huh.
<span>

So yea, Dorceans are cool they deserve a perfect <span style="color:#b0fc38;">**10/10**</span>!!


## CAERULEANS
<img src="https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/11/WondLa_Photo_010201-900x1200.jpg" width="350">
*Image from tvfanatic(dot)com*

Caeruleans are peculiar creatures, arguably the most interesting creature of Orbona. Caeruleans are similar to humans in many ways. They’re humanoid, looking like humans wearing an animal mascot. They move like humans, think like humans, and have a culture that is very similar to humans’.

Looking into it, Caeruleans seem to represent the collectivist, nature-oriented culture that particular ancient humans had. They have nomadic villages reminiscent of ancient humans’ settlements. They have hierarchy, roles, and a solid concept of family. In harmony with nature, they built interesting things including a house that flies like a hot air balloon and a candy translator (literally magic like whaaaa). They also have a festival celebrating being in tune with a God-like entity, The Heart (more on The Heart later). Another notable thing is how they despise humans apparently for destroying the earth. Valid. And it’s one of the driving points of the series.  I did wish the fact was confronted more throughout the series. Overall, we can say that the Caeruleans represent a calling for humans to embrace this culture at least in its ideal glory. A solarpunk dream (just have to mention it RAAAAH).

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  Eva 9 captured interesting conflicts within their culture. Mostly the family vs. village conflict. Pathfinder Rovender Kitt left the village after a disaster took his wife and children, an unforgivable action in the eyes of the village, being the only pathfinder they have. Coming back terminally ill, the village led by his own father denied him entry as well as medicine, which was rather cold tbh. Curiously, Eva 9 managed to lawyer Rovender’s ahh by appealing to emotions, pointing out how Rovender is her found-family and the fact that hello chief, he’s your son?  I mean it's a kids show but what a bad court hearing it was from the start.
</span>

Caeruleans would be <span style="color:#98bf64;">**8.5/10**</span> they’re interesting!!


## WATER BEARS
<img src="https://dl.moviesr.net/images2/tDdpo.jpg" width="350">
*Image from moviesr(dot)net*

Water bears are cutieeeeeessss. These gentle giants are reminiscent of the microscopic tardigrades – creatures known for their extraordinary resilience. Orbonian water bears do not seem to possess such resilience, but they have great stamina and are able to glide in the air all despite their massiveness. Like tardigrades, they have big blobby bodies. Tho they only have 4 legs (??) and they have this red-orange fur-like skin covering them. Water bears can swim and they eat fish. Otto is a notable character, showing loyalty reminiscent of dogs ancient humans used to have.

For reference, this is a tardigrade:

I would say <span style="color:#5dbb63;">**9/10**</span> cause they’re cute hehe.


## SAND SNIPERS
<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/545919bde4b0284d244016c6/ef89d9e5-fa59-485c-b6fe-0335df994ed7/Screenshot+2024-06-28+at+10.20.32%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?format=750w" width="350">
*Image from ICON Creative Studio*

Sand snipers are like crabs that burrow in the ground (sandy or not). They can be cute, but they’re quite dangerous especially when in groups. They’re bright, colorful, and have big cute eyes.

Interestingly, the book portrays a more terrifying grasshopper-like appearance. The following pic shows a baby one:
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wondla/images/d/d0/Screen_Shot_2021-08-05_at_12.21.16_AM.png/revision/latest?cb=20210805042157" width="350">
*Image from WondLa wiki*

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  DID I MENTION THAT A SAND SNIPER ARMY IS THE ONE THE KILLED BESTEEL?!
</span>

Not to be confused with sandpipers (I searched baby sand sniper and I got shown this cute churi).
<img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/bf3f6115-8d46-4e39-88bd-6394ca948010/plover_chick_square.jpg" width="350">
*Image from animalia-life(dot)club*

Btw that’s <span style="color:#5dbb63;">**9.5/10**</span> they’re interesting last-minute saviours (aka deus ex machina) throughout the series. I love them smm.


## ARSIANS
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/b382da394b710a5c2ed31828a54ab07c9e6701f6ae9ca15ac974e5b4fb7f0feb._BR-6_AC_SX720_FMjpg_.jpg" width="350">
*Image from Amazon*

Mystical is what they are! It is said that only four of them reside in Obona: siblings Darius, Loroc, Arius, and Zin. They have blobby bodies adorned by multiple hands all around. I can’t help but marvel at them every time they appear on screen. Perhaps my fave character design of all of them. 

Arsians possess great intelligence, having occupations like collecting memories in exchange of information, curating, being an advisor for the Queen, and “predicting” the future. The siblings themselves possess a great range of personalities and lore, most of which are quite extreme.

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  We can say Loroc is the final boss in the series, leading an alien army to battle humans. His cunningness overthrew the kingdom at that time in a coup. Yk what’s shocking? In the book, Loroc apparently ate his siblings and then himself. Truly a freaking beast he was. I kinda love how unexpected yet brutal it was. The complexity, ambiguity, etc. of the end is just something, even if it’s just another BIG FINAL BATTLE HOOYAJHH.
</span>

Overall, they deserve a perfect <span style="color:#b0fc38;">**10/10**</span>!! Such cool creatures!


## QUEEN OJO
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/086/030/076/large/edson-bonilla-queen-ojo-v004.jpg?1742234063" width="350">
*Image from Edson Bonilla (arstation(dot)com)*

Queen Ojo is of a unique species, imma put her since she represents them all anyway. The humanoid being is reminiscent of an axolotl – those cute Mexican amphibians. Speaking of Mexico, it’s interesting that her name is ojo – eye in Spanish. While ancient humans would associate it with totalitarianism, a leadership where a dictator watches you in every corner, Queen Ojo is actually a benevolent leader. 

Queen Ojo is a petite yet tall creature, possessing both the brains and the heart. Her race led the exodus to the planet ages ago, ruling it ever since.

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  I love the consistency in her character (I really thought she would leave the Lacus residents in that part lol). Her friendship with Eva is a slay one too (imagine being friends and bestfriending with THE QUEEN lol). She’s just overall a cool person and probably my fave character.
</span>

The Queen and her race of course gets the perfect score <span style="color:#b0fc38;">**10/10**</span>, they’re really cool.


## DAWOSU
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/0eb888d553b39637af3206171f874d34a8fb7b2efa245ae8e657d4670fa55439._SX1080_FMjpg_.jpg" width="350">
*Image from Amazon*

The Dawosu is a fearsome creature known for its terrifying size and speed, zooming through the wastelands in massive streaks of color. Appearance-wise, the Dawosu is a dazzling, adorable giant moth complete with sparkles around. Another favorite character design of mine.

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  It is however highly dangerous ofc and I really liked the rollercoaster of a scene where a dawosu confronted Eva 9 and nearly killed her with its scorpion tail.
</span>

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  Interestingly we see some dawosu teaming upp with Eva 9 in the final battle, suspending the assumption that they are cunning beaches that would never be trusted. Maybe that one really just wants to protect her young…
<span>

Of course it’s <span style="color:#b0fc38;">**10/10**</span>. Yes, I love it when cute but dangerous, how can you tell?


## AIRWHALE
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wondla/images/c/c4/Air_Whales.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160604162959" width="350">
*Image from Wondla wiki*

I love air whales and I love how they always appear when alien world wahaha. I always imagine them myself too, doodling them and stuff. We probably yearn for a friendly gigantic flying creature ig. Orbonian airwhales are HUGEEE and just dwell in the air peacefully. They basically chill. Appearance-wise they don’t really resemble ancient Orbonian whales, which were found in the oceans. They are more like stonefishes with their wide and rock-like appearances, of course without the poisons.

Let’s give them <span style="color:#98bf64;">**8/10**</span>.


## WANDERING TREE
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wondla/images/4/4d/Wandering_Tree.png/revision/latest?cb=20160605181054" width="350">
*Image from Wondla wiki*

The wandering tree is another chill creature I really like and perhaps the most interesting flora on the planet. Aided with tentacles, the massive, thick tree walks – wanders – across the dry wasteland, stopping at spots where there is water underground.

What I like about them is their design being kind of like a thick cylinder of leaves with big flowers protruding around. The wandering tree may serve as refugee and even a home to some Orbonian creatures. A house that moves, gets you water, and looks so slay sounds amazing tbh.

Pretty nice <span style="color:#5dbb63;">**9.5/10**</span>.


## THE HEART
<img src="https://myket.ir/asset-files/movies/episodes/xlarge/76af0e8b-4dfd-49a7-ae66-a9e9fe528b6c.jpg" width="350">
*Image from myket(dot)ir*

The heart is an interesting being. It’s basically everything. The source and energy of Orbonian life. It’s portrayed as a geometric ball with eyes?? (be not afraid). 

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  The eye is a convenient packaging of all the main conflicts of Wondla. Because everything is packed into a single ball, it’s easy to plot the conflicts and the battles and the ending and even the past lore. Again it’s a kids movie but I do crave for a deeper, more complex lore (me ignoring the back of my mind telling me to read the book lol).
</span>

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  And we can see that it’s ultimately a battle between nature and individuals who want to exploit it for resources. Ultimately, ofc, the good guys won and nature prevailed. And we are led to believe they simply learned to live in harmony with nature. A solarpunk dre-
</span>

The heart also has this ability to like, connect? infect? consume?? other creatures, messing with their memories, showing them dazzling visuals that may or may not be the secrets of the universe, taking the form of their loved ones… to like, prevail and survive. It’s a complex, interesting being and I wish it is explored more and not merely used as a plot accelerator. 

The book does offer interesting background about this mystreious being, taking the form of a The Mother. Apparently, a Muthr unit ingested (they DRINK?!?!?!? Maybe the author knows AI is a water drinker in 2010 lolololll) contaminated water. Essentially this being *infects* the flora and fauna around it, creating the rich wildlife of Orbona that we know today.

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wondla/images/4/45/The_Mother.png/revision/latest?cb=20210803060042" width="350">
*Image from Wondla wiki*

Fantastic creature <span style="color:#98bf64;">**8/10**</span>.


## HUMANS
<img src="https://www.animationmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/WondLa030402.jpg" width="350">
*Image from animationmagazine(dot)net*

The star of the show is of course this beach creature. Known for destroying their planet and prevailing via underground sanctuaries, humans have a lot of atonement to do. Humans feature a plethora of cultures and personalities. Capable of love and betrayal and character development and resilience and persistence and intelligence and love. The what-does-it-mean-to-be-human angle may be an interesting direction for the series, tackling what humans can do to make up for their destructive past and dark reputation.

Eva 9 is a notable human on the planet, the only surviving kid from the underground sanctuary she was in. Eva 9 has a unique, superhuman ability of telepathy – with animals!! Alien animals!!! We can only dream of that. Eva 9 is effortlessly cool without being consumed by the cool-girl-wawawawwwww trope (me love cool girls, such as-). She has incredible persistence that is, admittedly, annoying sometimes. But as we see, Eva 9 always knows what she is doing. There’s none of those BUT-I-DID-THIS-OUT-OF-THE-SCREEN-ALL-ALONG bs, it’s all JUST-DO-IT-AND-FACE-CONSEQUENCES-HECK-YA and it’s fun to see it push the plot forward.

**[SPOILER]** <span style="background-color:#333;" onclick="this.style.color='white'"> 
  Interestingly, Eva 9 is a clone. The 9th clone, as her name suggests. Eva 8 is an interesting character, like why did the beach switch up and betrayed Eva 9? Very un-eva but I guess even clones have different personalities.
</span>

Imma give <span style="color:#5dbb63;">**9/10**</span> for Eva 9, hehe, get it?

Humans have, no doubt, unmatched spirits and intelligence. No wonder these balding ape-like creatures can strike fear in some. They’re something, capable of anything. They can love unconditionally, or betray their closest kin. Ultimately, they are still finding their place in Orbona. Through the series of events seen through the lens of Eva 9, we see a new world filled with old ghosts. This entire thing regarding humans still has a long way to develop, but yk humans. Even after hundreds of years, their spirit prevails. Hopefully in the new-yet-ancient world of Wondla they finally settle and learn to live sustainably – a solarpunk dream. 

## BONUS

#### “Miya”
Nobody knows what species really is Miya who goes as far back as the ancient human’s time. It’s unclear when, but girl definitely was there when humanity perished, and when today’s Orbonians first crashed into the planet. Not even the author dares to provide more info about her and it’s highly recommended not to pursue the subject. Miya is just notable for putting immediate attention to this peak series that she apparently took interest in. Slay reccom! And as for the ratings, of course she’s the coolest, most slayable Orbonian there iss <span style="color:#ffdf00;">**1000000/10**</span> hehe.

#### Apple
Apple is a species of flora found in ancient Orbona, notable for its fruit which had various cultural impacts with ancient humans. It seems that there’s a certain group of humans who collectively called themselves Apple in the past, famous for ancient technologies such as “smartphones” (basically an omnipod’s great great great great great great great grandpa). But frr idk they make shows like woaaaaaaaa. Apple (the group, not the flora species) was notable for tackling the aforementioned narrative of Orbona and the mysterious WondLa on screen, featuring nice cute animations and solid pacing. Of course there's this unstoppable urge to be the BUT IN DA BOOOK IT ISSS- person, especially with the fluffified character designs. But it still held up without being overly cutesy. The series overall is short and easy to watch, well it's a kids show. It’s overall fun!! 

#### “Tony"
Tony DiTerlizzi is an ancient human who tackled the whole WondLa thing through books – a bunch of physical papers with a whole ahh universe inside them (are there books in Orbona?!?!?!?!?!?!!?! I mean iirc there were bookshelves??). Haven’t read the book but it looks so slay hehe., with a more lore heavy, more detailed, darker tale. Kids lost in an post-apocalyptic alien world sound sooooo compelling (glances at my fave manga, TPN). Cool human, I wonder how did he react with the adaptation of his slay trilogy.

<br>
