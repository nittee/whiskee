#### The Internet is an Alternative Outside World

We live in the digital age. Gadgets, the internet, and online services are starting to gain significant roles in our everyday lives. When the pandemic hit in 2020, it sank deeper in Filipinos’ lives. Online shopping, e-wallets, streaming services, working from home, and online classes became commonplace. Filipinos became more immersed than ever before on the internet. Since we were barred from the outside world, the internet became our new “outside world”. And I believe that it’s always been an alternative “outside world”, in a sense that it's a gateway to the world around us. A vast place with all things good and ugly.

Internet use in children is generally viewed with concern. The usual consensus is to restrict them from using it. To close this alternative outside world for them. It’s an understandable mindset. But as far as I can observe, it’s wide open for Filipino children. It’s common to see a toddler immersed in Youtube kids channels such as Cocomelon. Games like Roblox and Mobile Legends bring the addictive joy of video games from pisonet cafes to mobile devices. There’s a good chance that a typical elementary schooler has at least one social media account, despite the fact that the majority of social media prohibit minors. These are all amplified by the pandemic, bringing education to the online world. For the first time, an important aspect of children’s life - education - requires the internet. Not only did they have to commit a few hours to online meeting platforms such as Zoom, they also had to create emails and even Facebook accounts to communicate and pass their requirements. They had to get more involved in the internet to bridge their education.
As a computer science major, internet safety for children is among my chief concerns in my field. I tried to stay in touch with all the issues involving it, but the disturbing nature of some of these made me realize why not a lot of people try to confront and analyze it. But that doesn’t mean that it should stay taboo. To be honest, it’s pretty hard to provide concrete solutions or projects without understanding this complex and evolving phenomenon. So right now, the main goal is simply to understand it. Doing that, I came up with this. The idea that the internet is just an alternative outside world.

#### The Outside World is Dangerous

Everyone knows that. From simple environmental risks such as the sun to actual dangerous people, the outside world offers plenty of ways to harm a curious child. This is certainly true on the internet. During the pandemic, these dangers were spotlighted as more Filipinos became aware of them. Sadly, responses to them were limited.

Internet privacy was a concern due to scams, hackings, and breaches that happened in the country. Today, there are still a good bunch of children and adults who are missing out on privacy. Aside from unnecessary sharing of personal information, some of them seem to not know basic privacy settings in social media. Some parents, for example, make hundreds of photos of their children accessible to everyone on the planet who can access the site, including predators.

Speaking of predators, there had been multiple mini-scandals involving them during the pandemic. These involve online groups, accounts, and channels which engage in actions that endanger children. Even in the aforementioned game Roblox, there was a rumor concerning a “game” that endangers children. Sadly, there were no widespread preventative measures done as a response to what arguably is the worst danger to children on the internet. Not even an online movement or trend, despite all those mini-scandals.

Inappropriate content is also a concern involving this. Safe search can easily be bypassed. In fact, it seems that it’s turned off by default with adult google accounts. This means that a child using their parent’s account has access to potentially inappropriate content. Even apps that supposedly create a safe space for children are not safe. Youtube Kids for example faced backlash for their algorithm that leads children to inappropriate content. A phenomenon referred to as “Elsagate”.

Everyone already knows these, as I mentioned. So why is there a good bunch of children with unsupervised access on the internet? Either not everyone knows, or worse, everyone knows but not everyone cares.

#### The Outside World Offers a Huge Space for Growth

Banning children from the internet seemed like a great idea. But seeing it as akin to barring them from the outside world, it made me rethink it. The outside world is instrumental for the development of children’s social skills, exploration of new things, and giving avenues for children to express themselves. One doesn’t have to be a child psychologist to know that locking children up would hamper some aspects of their development. The internet, as dangerous as it is, does offer these things but in a different realm. Responsible internet use enables children to be technologically literate, curious, confident, and creative.

A lot of children today would find their own passion on the internet, such as drawing, sports, and science. A lot of child-friendly media on the internet also has great potential to inspire a lot of young minds. Children are really fast learners, and it can be surprising how fast they can pick up things. It is observed with a simple example of language. Nowadays, children as young as 4 speaking perfect English sentences are normal thanks to the internet - a phenomenon jokingly referred to as “Peppa Pig Effect”. Whereas I could never form a coherent English sentence until I reached junior highschool. Even complex and educational topics can be communicated on the internet. I remember a trend called "touch meme" where kids would color an outline of a person based on how much they allow to be touched there. For example, coloring the head red means it’s a big no-no for them to be touched on their head. Personally, it’s a creative way to introduce the concept of boundaries to young children. And of course, it doesn’t have to be a trend more than it has to be a resource for a little parent-child discussion about such topics.

The internet, most importantly, provides communication and socialization skills for children in the realm of the online. Aside from gaining skills and experience with how to navigate online communication, they can also have a chance to socialize with their families and fellow children no matter where they are. It also provides an avenue to express themselves in a safe space. Of course, there is still the danger of talking to strangers. But it’s hardly different from the real outside world.

#### Education and Guidance are Important for Children's Journey in the Outside World

With the increasingly internet-dependent world, I believe it’s still crucial for children to explore the internet to gain skills, learn new things, or simply to have fun. In the same way that we would always guide young children in the real outside world, we should also guide them as they explore the internet. 

Another important thing is creating a safe space for them on the internet, which is also a thing with the real outside world. More than just censoring every remotely risky thing, it involves a collaboration between us the users, the service providers, and the government. It’s a big world, too big for them. But with our guidance, we can make meaningful adventures with it for them.

Education is also crucial, both for children and adults who guide them. In the real world, we wouldn’t bring children to places we don’t fully understand. A technologically literate exploration ensures that everyone is aware about the terrain they are treading on.

At the end of the day, these are all just ideas based on my personal observations and a bit of data. My concern is more about bringing these known and important issues back to light than educating. An attempt to understand and suggest solutions to an important issue. I believe that we can all be united with our genuine drive to make the world a better place for children, both in the real world and the virtual world. May we understand how to guide them to explore this new and ever-evolving world.
