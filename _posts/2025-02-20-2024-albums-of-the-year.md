*I’m back! And instead of politics and stuff, maybe we can talk about something fun, yeah?*

<br>

My very first journaling-journey was a mess, but first times are supposed to be like that I guess. Thanks to January 2023 me, I managed to record every album and EP that I enjoyed throughout the year. It was indeed a good idea. I was anticipating this moment. As Spotify wrapped comes out, I’ll make a “wrapped” of my own. Something that is less boring than the Spotify one, perhaps.

> I finished this list in early December 2023 and I was planning to post it here on first week of 2025, but here we are T.T (I did post it on [redacted] tho)

I recorded more than 60 banger albums and more than a dozen EPs. Spanning every genre I could find. Yes, I’m one of those “I listen to everything” people. I would say I listened to almost 300 new albums a day. Here is my top 15 discoveries (excluding EPs) this year:

#### 15. It’s a Wonderful Life by Sparklehorse

This is definitely recency bias. November 28, when the anticipated Spotify wrapped (it was delayed for like a week) was just around the corner. This is among my last discoveries. I simply stumbled upon one of its singles (I can’t remember which), recommended by Spotify’s algorithm. A rare gem it did give.

*It’s a Wonderful Life* exudes this “fairy” energy that I love. It’s serene, nostalgic, and earthly, like being in a peaceful cottage in the middle of a forest. I love the slow melodies and the folky instruments. This cottagecore-ish genre (not even sure if it is a genre) is one I’ve always wanted to explore more. I wanna unleash the inner fairy in me.


#### 14 - Hit Me Hard and Soft by Billie Eilish

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/e69971625c379772fb79213dccfa194f.jpg)

*Hit Me Hard and Soft* was a personal surprise as someone who doesn’t listen to her. Did not enjoy her half-sung half-whispered breakthrough songs in 2019, putting her under the umbrella of Generic Music That Teenage Girls Somehow Enjoy. Been avoiding that umbrella for a while. I wouldn’t say out of snobbery, I’m probably just too fearful to approach that glittery culture. Taylor Swift is enough, Taylor Swift is enough, I would whisper to myself as I avoid it. Fortunately, I’m an “I listen to everything” person – since 2023. So I found myself diving blindly into the world of the likes of Chappel Roan, Marina, Sabrina Carpenter, and eventually in October, Billie. Maybe my indie pop obsession was my gateway to that dreaded umbrella.

And indie-ish it was. This album lacks the breathless gasping that I associate with Billie. It’s a 10-track banger featuring romantic melodies and slick beats that builds up into crazy breakdowns I wouldn't expect to hit hard. *Hit Me Hard and Soft* did hit me hard and soft. I’m pretty confident that this is her best work yet. 

PS. It definitely is more deserving than *Cowboy Carter* (yass, I heard that album too).

#### 13 - I am not Shinzo Abe by Xinlisupreme

My shoegaze exploration landed me one August afternoon to this peculiar Japanese album. How political this work is – referencing a former Prime Minister in Japan – is personally unclear, but it slaps no matter what.

Shoegaze is basically noise that feels comforting, however oddly it does. *I am not Shinzo Abe* is like that, noise that feels comforting. But not in a way that shoegaze normally is. Shoegaze sounds like the wind from the ocean at night. Cool and wooshy. This album drills my ears with explosive sounds reminiscent of chainsaws and storms. Yet… it sounds hella comforting. Not sure if it is even shoegaze, but it does hit hard.

#### 12 - Stomach Book by Stomach Book

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/39558f3e679d88ffd06f3e70a440a48e.jpg)

This April discovery is quite hard to describe, but fortunately, the cover art illustrates how it sounds perfectly. *Stomach Book* boasts such colorful chaos that leaves you covered in confetti or whatever those colorful stuff are. This explosive, unserious, hell-yeah of an album is such a fun gem.

#### 11 - Mother Earth’s Plantasia by Mort Garson

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/d88379eb206fa2f5abef8351aff188a0.jpg)

Some guy in the 1970’s thought it’s a good idea to create an album just for plants, using synthesizers. Now, some guy in the 2020’s thought he’s a fucking genius because this album slaps. Hearing this for the first time in May makes it much better.

I imagine solarpunk – futuristic utopia featuring sustainable development elements OOOH I LOVE THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED CONCEPT MAYBE I’LL MAKE A WHOLE BLOG OF IT SOMETIME >.<  – aesthetic as something like this. *Mother Earth’s Plantasia* features cute swirling synth melodies that exudes earthly comfort for both humans and plants. Definitely a must-have in a solarpunk ship gliding across outer space with all its rich vegetation and clean energy.

#### 10 - Rossz Csillag Alatt Született by Venetian Snares

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/0b9be95745f84725add703ee64c0c9b7.jpg)

It is translated as… \*looks at notes\*... “born under a bad star”. Now that’s a freaking metal AF title. One August Monday, I stumbled upon a Hungarian language masterpiece – apparently, it’s inspired by the Canadian musician’s visit to Hungary.

This is breakcore taken SERIOUSLY, maybe the lack of anime-ish cutegore aesthetic in the cover hints at that. It’s a flipping stock photo of birds in the sky. With orchestral elements and masterful production, this album is immersive and cinematic. It’s something I wouldn’t expect breakcore to sound like.

#### 9 - Sound of the Satellites by Laika

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/f806673170d845c69962aedfcd00ffda.jpg)

What a July highlight. From a band named after Laika, the first dog sent to space (RIP), this album is among the most charming space rock out there. Bringing the wholesomeness to the trippy genre, it exudes such comforting energy that one feels when staring at a snowglobe like the one on the cover art. It’s the most lullaby-y space rock I’ve ever heard since Pink Floyd’s song, "Julia Dream". Don’t you just love it when childish sugar fluff meets the trippy outer space?

#### 8 - Float Along - Fill Your Lungs by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/b30e4e96683d4db6b05b677ef5d1c4b7.jpg)

KGLW is famous for their wild work ethic – seemingly producing album after album monthly – and their reimagining of the ‘60s psychedelia sound. It’s quite intimidating to explore their massive, ever expanding catalogue. Strangely, no album quite hit the spot in me for a while, until I stumbled upon this seemingly unremarkable green one in October. This slaps as hard as space rock can. It’s crazy how the trippy songs stretch for as long as 15 minutes yet there’s not a dull moment throughout the album. It’s an immersive trip from top to bottom.

#### 7 - Abyss by Pastel Ghost

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/1dc65900838671380545198cc03d653e.jpg)

Pastel ghost, no other name can fit them better. And no album art could fit this album better. Branded as “dark rave”, this August discovery is an immersive electronica served at the perfect temperature such that it is both stone cold and soothing. Is this pastel goth? because omgg.

#### 6 - Atomizer by Big Black

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/e47e04a3810a6b46f984aa3118420dd3.jpg)

This may not be punk, but it’s among the most punk album that I’ve ever discovered. The cover art alone caught my attention. It’s quite expressive. It was March 2024, when the band’s catalogue wasn’t on Spotify yet. So I discovered their brash brand of industrial on Youtube. Tackling vulgar, disturbing topics over guitars that slice like knives to your ears and drums that rumble the ground may sound intimidating. But it’s a well-produced masterpiece that is worth daring to listen to – at least if one is fine with industrial.

#### 5 - Buried Secrets by Painkiller

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/c02eb1e89d992c2ab4631b8b61329062.jpg)

Another ear breaker on this list, this is what happens when you combine jazz and freaking grindcore. The result is a bone chilling sax barrage that actually – I’m not exaggerating – sounds like souls being tortured in hell. This may not sound like it’s something one listens for fun but imo it’s quite a masterpiece both in jazz and in grindcore. I actually had fun with this that fateful June afternoon. I’m pretty sure there are very few albums that are as terrifying as this.

#### 4 - Legend by Jannabi

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/73777ca2cfbecdda879f1d93d977455d.jpg)

So so beautiful this album. Perhaps the most popular K-indie there is, I discovered it when a girl I kiiiiiiiinda like recommended me their most popular single "For Lovers Who Hesitate". The tune of that song alone is enough to make one fall in love and maybe not hesitate – ugh what an odd thing to say as someone who still hesitated ://

But a young girl I knew did fall in love with a friend after getting a request to play this song. Ah, the carefree-ness of teenage love. 

Anyway, this album carries that romantic tune throughout the album, featuring build-ups overflowing with oxytocin and sugary melancholia. How can you not fall in love with this. This is love in album form. And yes, since July 2023 I declare love’s color as milky yellow, why was it red in the first place anyway?

#### 3 - Modal Soul by Nujabes

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/e605e0031a208775b7ac76f8c34290e3.jpg)

My introduction to lo-fi hiphop’s grandfather is this masterpiece, featuring the jazzy, funky, trippy sound of lofi. I just love it when rap is like pink cotton candy instead of carrying the usual street gangsta aesthetic. *Modal Soul* has ear-catching beats of piano and jazzy tunes that occupied my brain in the entirety of March. Who knew a rap masterpiece can sound like a trip to a flower shop?

#### 2 - Trans Balkan Express by O.M.F.O.

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/6bce3a4cdd2b4b36a3c535bb49241dbc.jpg)

It’s always charming when the futuristic vision and the rich cultural past meets and marries. *Trans Balkan Express* married the Kraftwerk-ish brand of minimalist electronica and… East European folk! Discovered it in May. Apart from the noble vision, the unseriousness and the carefree attitude of it all made it a fun adventure. Maybe the German dudes Kraftwerk need to be a little whimsical, or perhaps a little more human (still love em!).

#### 1 - Shalimar by R.D. Burman

![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/500x500/5a39f85b8c9f41ed9334142f4e35a9e1.jpg)

This February discovery turned out to be the biggest surprise of the year. ‘70s Bollywood music doesn’t sound promising, but this album brought me into the world of all these colorful melodies and God-tier voices. Not to mention how oddly soothing the overall atmosphere is – like a relaxing Sunday morning. Maybe that soulful characteristic is innate for old records, especially ones that are new to me.

It’s amazing when something 100% new turned out to be 100% banger. That’s the best thing about discovering new music – or new things in general.

<br>

So those are my favorite album discoveries in the past year. Of course it may not be for everyone, but that's the beauty of art: it resonates to people in different ways!
