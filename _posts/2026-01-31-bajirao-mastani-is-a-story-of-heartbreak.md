*[Image from DNA India] Another reviewwww (this was delayed for MONTHS btw)*

<br>

When I watched the music video of the Bollywood song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6lHUn20J5g">“Deewani Mastani”</a>, for the first time, I can only say my jaw dropped. Beautiful music, mesmerizing performance from the famous Deepika Padukone, and most of all the dazzling golden visuals that are at an epic level. I would say it sums up the overall vibe of the movie, “Bajirao Mastani” (2015). In fact, that music video was a really good trailer. It made me interested in the movie and what I could experience amidst its stunning shots. I don't really know a Bollywood movie can achieve such epicness.

That song is a close friend’s favorite, mentioned on a whim. Girl must’ve thought I didn’t put it in my list and mentally noted myself to watch it soon. Told me again and again to watch it already watch it already watch it already! Saying it’s “peak” – really good. Well, it was and a few days later I found myself watching the movie before she even did! Watch it na watch it na watch it na!

“Bajirao Mastani” touches upon the love life of Bajirao I, a mighty warrior and fearsome leader of a 1700’s Indian empire – a *Peshwa* of the Maratha Empire. Of course, it highlights his second wife and apparent greatest love, Mastani. Mastani was a daughter of a Hindu Rajput King and his Muslim concubine, with she herself being a Muslim. This love between them, as seen in the movie, prevailed against all the wars, personal beefs, and of course political and religious barriers. I would say it’s the central theme of the movie. 

I see this technique in Bollywood where romantic development is represented through a song. Most of the time, it’s a lazy technique. The woman trying to attract the man the male bird way, the hopelessly lovestruck man swaying along. That’s it, that’s how they fell for each other. “Deewani Mastani” is no different. We see Deepika as Mastani, wearing a beautiful golden lehenga featuring a layered skirt, sequins, and embroidery patterns in floral and *gota patti* technique. It’s said to weigh about 20 kg. I would say dancing and spinning while carrying a sack of rice would be exhausting. On top of that are traditional jewelry and of course a lethal face card. Who could out-male-bird this woman for real?! Of course we have the man passively sitting, still retaining the authoritative, regal look. Played by Ranveer Singh, Bajirao presents an intimidating, fearsome aura suitable for a *Peshwa*. Yet his character never felt cold, especially towards both – yes, both – of his lovers. Truly an alpha, is he?

As mentioned earlier, the music video captured the overall vibe of the movie. We see Mastani’s point of view, her love overflowing with its golden elegance, and Bajirao’s as well, showcasing how he helplessly, deeply, falls in love with the gorgeous Mastani. There is another point of view, however, that is worth mentioning. In fact, my emotional experience with the movie was mostly influenced by her lens. I’m talking about the girl sitting on a balcony watching everything unfold in a quiet yet resounding pain: Kashibai, Bajirao’s wife. This dynamic between the three drives the narrative of the movie. As we follow their bitter journey, we see how love navigates the complex landscape of politics, culture, religion, and personal issues. Despite being an unstoppable force, portrayed with poetry and cultural symbolisms, we still see love endure thorns and bloody spears along its way.

“Bajirao Mastani” is epic in many ways. Because beyond all the beautiful, breathtaking scenes, we see love in its complex raw form. It’s kind of a shame to know that historical accuracy is sacrificed for cinema. But you know what, they did it freaking well. This movie is absolute cinema.

  ">SPOILER CORNER</summary>

  <p>
    My first – and lasting – impression with the movie, just like the music video of the mentioned song, is its *epicness*. The shots are beautiful and well-done. The characters and their designs are all slay. The songs of course are bangers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apart from these, I also wanted to point out the dialogue and how poetic they are, the cultural and historical setting incorporated with the script. For example, we see the beautiful scene of the love declaration of the two. We see Mastani giving a paan to Bajirao, showing a culture which may or may not be specific only to that time period. This action will be seen later again, this time with Kashibai. The contrast and conflict of these two instances highlights the overall tension between the two lovers. But what gave the scene its dreamy, passionate soul is the dialogue. When the two declared a love that can stop the sun from rising and make the night last forever, we felt it. It was reminiscent of reading a romantic poem from the past era, boasting big words and amazing imagery. The movie itself slowed down at that moment, and it wasn’t only because of Mastani’s beautiful face lighted up by torch fire, shown at a subtly passionate angle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bajirao met Mastani as a brave warrior, encompassing the classic badass girl trope. The trope didn’t hold up on the rest of the movie, tho Mastani maintained the fierce, bold personality from start to finish. The romantic development between the two developed quickly yet naturally from here, culminating in this curious dagger wedding scene. You see, in Rajput tradition (Mastani’s culture), giving your dagger to your girl is basically what a wedding is. So when Bajirao casually gave his dagger to Mastani one night, a probably delulu Mastani thought they’re getting married – or at least being engaged. This is something idk, like is it automatically a wedding already? Are they officially spouses from that moment forward? As Mastani believed? It’s a very weird case of miscommunication trope. But at least it is clear to us that the two do love each other, slowly but surely it develops.

    *The beautiful Aaina Mahal – palace of mirrors. The movie set repotedly used thousands of mirrors. Seeing it slowly come to life as the light ushers in were one of the most eye-yummy scenes in the movie*
  </p>

  <p>
    As the romance develops, we see one woman’s heart slowly being broken to pieces – Kashibai’s heart. Kashi was just as gorgeous and graceful and kind as Mastani. And it’s kinda devastating to see her break apart, especially in the Aaina Mahal scene, where her confidently, positively, hopefully in-love ahh saw Bajirao and Mastani locked in a passionate kiss. It was a painful watch, seeing her heart finally shatter completely after cracking slowly for a long time.

    *My fave Mastani look in the movie, the pink and green here is just so slayy*
  </p>

  <p>
    We see the two women navigate this landscape with grace and respect. In a twist of fate, both women got pregnant at the same time! Like I doubt if it is historically accurate but zamnnn. This Bajirao boi is such a-
  </p>

  <p>
    Naturally, Mastani was shunned and belittled by Bajirao’s family, and girl had to endure all the humiliations and even physical threats with it. Through these obstacles, we saw both Mastani’s passion and Bajirao’s commitment for their relationship. Meanwhile, Kashi is slowly taking in the fact that she’s not Bajirao’s first choice. Through the traditional exchanges, she slowly pushed him more and more away. It was until one day, during Bajirao’s visit, she officially broke up with him. In the dramatic yet calm exchange, she compared their relationships to those of Hindu deities, Krishna and Rukhimi.

    *My fave shot, portraying a beautiful -- and heartbreaking -- scene of Kashi crying in a paradise garden-like setting. It looks like a painting!*
  </p>

  <p>
    The climax climaxed hard near the end, when Mastani was imprisoned while Bajirao fought battles so much he got sick. Kashi was the one who nursed him, but upon seeing her, Bajirao uttered Mastani’s name...
  </p>

  <p>
    The movie ended with both lovers dying. Mastani chained in her prison while Bajirao fights hallucinations violently. At last they met again… I loved that scene so much.
  </p>

  <p>
    And where did Kashi go? She wasn’t present in the dramatic ending, but she was what stayed with me after I watched it. As romantic and epic Bajirao and Mastani’s love were, it was Kashi’s pain that I felt the most. Kashi had always taken care of Bajirao until the end, even noticing his devotion to Mastani, and acting upon it for Bajirao. The narrative of Bajirao Mastani showed how a great love flourished while one’s heart got shattered.
